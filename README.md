# odin-recipes
This is my first project that i am uploading to the github. This is a part of the odin project. The project is about creating multiple web pages that consists of different recipes. 
I created a index.html file that is the main page through which we can access the other recipes.
The concepts that are used in completing the project are:
1. Basic html boilerplate.
2. Headings.
3. Paragraphs.
4. Images.
5. Unordered list.
6. ordered list.

Also, i learned how to commit and push in to github using vscode which is a very simplified process as well.
